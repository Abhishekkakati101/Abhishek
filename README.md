# Introduction:
Hello my name is Abhishek kakati, currently a 1st year CSE undergrad student at GIMT, Guwahati. I'm a summer intern at Cosmic Skills taking the Machine Learning course. This was an awesome course, so after completion of the project now its time for the Projects submission. For the projects I'm facing problems in converting the code files into .rar format, so I decided to make this repository and share the links of the consecutive projects in the mail.

# List to projects:
1.Character Recognition Project

2.Face Recognition Project

3.Recommendation System Project

4.Species Recognition Project

# Contents and Datails of the Project:

**1. Character Recognition Project -**

-PROJECT CONTENT DETAILS -

1) Project Name : Character Recognition Project

2) Aim of the Project : The aim of this project is to develop such a tool which takes an Image as input and extract characters (alphabets, digits, symbols) from it. The Image can be of handwritten document or Printed document. It can be used as a form of data entry from printed records.

3) Tools required for the development of the Project : This project is based on Machine learning, We can provide a lot of data set as an Input to the software tool which will be recognized by the machine and similar pattern will be taken out from them. We can use Matlab or Octave as a building tool for this product but Octave is recommended in initial state as its free and easy to use.

4) Project Output Images :
