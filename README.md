# Introduction:
Hello my name is Abhishek kakati, currently a 1st year CSE undergrad student at GIMT, Guwahati. I'm a summer intern at Cosmic Skills taking the Machine Learning course. This was an awesome course, so after completion of the project now its time for the Projects submission. For the projects I'm facing problems in converting the code files into .rar format, so I decided to make this repository and share the links of the consecutive projects in the mail.

# List to projects:
1.Character Recognition Project

2.Face Recognition Project

3.Recommendation System Project

4.Species Recognition Project
